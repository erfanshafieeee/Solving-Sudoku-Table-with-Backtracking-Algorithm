## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

At the heart of this Sudoku Solver is the **Backtracking Algorithm**, a classic recursive approach used to solve constraint satisfaction problems.

### üìñ Backtracking Algorithm in a Nutshell

1. **Start** by selecting the first empty cell.
2. **Try** placing a number (1-9) in the empty cell:
   - Check if the number is allowed:
     - It doesn't repeat in the same row.
     - It doesn't repeat in the same column.
     - It doesn't repeat in the 3x3 grid.
3. If the number is valid, place it and **move to the next cell**.
4. If the number is invalid, **backtrack** by resetting the cell and trying the next number.
5. **Repeat** this process until the entire puzzle is solved or all possibilities are exhausted.

This method ensures that every possibility is explored while respecting the Sudoku rules, making it both powerful and efficient.

## üéÆ How to Use

1. **Run the Program**:
   - Launch the Python script to open the Sudoku solver.
   
2. **Use the Preloaded Puzzle**:
   - The program starts with a pre-filled Sudoku board. Hit `Solve` to see the magic happen!

3. **Clear the Board**:
   - Want to try your own puzzle? Click the `Clear Board` button to reset the grid.

4. **Input Your Puzzle**:
   - Simply click on any cell and enter numbers (1-9). The cell will turn green if valid or red if invalid.

5. **Solve Your Puzzle**:
   - Once you're done entering your numbers, hit the `Solve` button to watch the solver in action.

6. **Invalid Puzzle Warning**:
   - If the inputted puzzle is invalid, you'll get a friendly error message letting you know.

### The Backtracking Algorithm Explained

This is a **depth-first search** algorithm used for solving constraint-based problems like Sudoku. It explores all possibilities for each cell before moving on to the next.

1. **Try** placing numbers in empty cells.
2. **Validate** the placement according to Sudoku's rules.
3. **Backtrack** if an invalid configuration arises.
4. **Continue** until the board is either solved or unsolvable.

## üé® How the Colors Work

- **Green**: Valid entries (numbers between 1-9).
- **Red**: Invalid entries (out-of-range or non-numeric values).
- **White**: Blank or unfilled cells, ready for input.

## üß† Why Backtracking?

**Backtracking** is perfect for Sudoku because it efficiently checks all potential number placements, ensuring the puzzle remains solvable under all constraints. It systematically tries different values for each empty cell, backtracking if conflicts occur, and moves forward if the value is valid.

### Benefits of Backtracking:

- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Adheres strictly to Sudoku rules (row, column, sub-grid).
- **Efficiency**: Avoids unnecessary work by backtracking as soon as a conflict is found.
- **Complete Solution**: Guarantees a solution if one exists, or confirms the puzzle is unsolvable.
